# Binary Search Solutions

This project contains two JavaScript functions that solve searching problems using binary search with `O(log n)` time complexity.

## Task 1: Search in a Sorted Array

Given a sorted array of integers and a target value, the function searches for the target and returns its index. If the target is not found, it returns `-1`.

### Example

```bash
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 9
Output: 4


```

## Task 2: Find Minimum in a Rotated Sorted Array
Given a rotated sorted array of unique elements, the function finds and returns the minimum element in the array.

### Example

```bash
Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
Output: 0

```

### Time and Space Complexity Summary

#### Task 1: Search in Sorted Array

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

#### Task 2: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
